# This configuration file is used by the image_store_plugin.

# Set one or more thresholds that the image_store_plugin will
# use to determine the disposition of an image.  Threshold values
# are floating point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0.  The numbers 
# must have a 0 or 1 to the left of the decimal point and at 
# least 1 digit to the right.  
#
# The possible thresholds and their meanings when an image has 
# a score that exceeds the threshold value are:
#
#  Save - save the image file 
#  ReduceSave - reduce the image resolution and save
#  Delete - discard the image
#
# The highest score in an image's list of scores determines the 
# action.  If no 0.0 threshold is explicitly assigned, "Delete = 0.0" 
# is implicitly assigned.
